# California Gothic
In 1953, California standardized the state flag in law.  Section 420 of the Government Code says:

```
The general design and the details of the Bear Flag, excluding colors, 
shall correspond substantially with the following representation
```

...and includes a low res sketch of the flag itself.  

### But hark!
No mention of a specific typeface to use for the iconic CALIFORNIA REPUBLIC text along the bottom of the flag.  Not even a family... or even serif / sans-serif.  Just "correspond substantially". Okay.

Long story short, this project aims to reverse-engineer a typeface based on high-resolution scans
of the letterforms from the original 1953 law.


## Open Font 
California Gothic is released under the SIL Open Font License, which you can read about in OFL.txt and 
OFL-FAQ.txt in this project.

## Roadmap
Source SVG files, and a combined OTF file, will generally be constructed thusly:

| | Version | What's New |
| --- | --- | --- |
| :soon: | 0.1 | Letters in CALIFORNIA REPUBLIC (plus a star and bear for good measure) |
| :white_large_square: | 0.2 | Basic Latin Capital Letters |
| :white_large_square: | 0.3 | Basic Latin Lowercase Letters |
| :white_large_square: | 0.4 | Basic Latin Symbols |
| :white_large_square: | 1.0 | Basic Latin spacing and OTF file |
| :white_large_square: | 1+ | Extended Latin |
