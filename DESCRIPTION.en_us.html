<h1>California Gothic</h1>
<p>
    California Gothic is a typeface based on the glyphs found on the California flag.  The typeface is a bold condensed sans-serif, reminiscent of classic gothic or grotesque style typefaces. The font is all-caps, and covers all the Unicode Basic Latin ranges, general punctuation, and many other characters.

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
    In 1953, California standardized the state flag in law.  Section 420 of the Government Code includes this low resolution sketch of the flag, and says:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <i>The general design and the details of the Bear Flag, excluding colors, shall correspond substantially with the following representation:</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
    No mention of a specific typeface to use for the iconic CALIFORNIA REPUBLIC text along the bottom of the flag.  
    Not even a family... or even serif / sans-serif.  Just "correspond substantially".
</p>
<p>
    This project aims to reverse-engineer a typeface based on high-resolution scans of the letter forms from the original 1953 law.
